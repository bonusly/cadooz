# cadooz

Ruby Wrapper for the cadooz SOAP Business Order web service

## Usage

How to use my plugin.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cadooz'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
$ gem install cadooz
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Publishing

This is a public repo, so we don't need to publish the gem in order to pull the changes into an application. Add this line to your Gemfile to get this gem: `gem "filereaderjs", github: "bonusly/filereaderjs"`

When you have changes that you want to pull into an app (i.e. something you would publish as a new version), you can just run `bundle update filereaderjs` in the repo.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
